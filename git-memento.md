## Memento of main commands & functions

 ## 1. General Schedule :  
-------------

1. Connect to Github and copy the clone-URL of wanted repository.
2. Clone the repo in your local folder.
      > git clone url
3. Access the folder and check existing features (branches, files, ...).
      > cd repositoryName  
      > ls  
      > git branch
4. Create a new branch and move into it.
      > git branch branchName  
      > git checkout branchName
5. Verify the version of the file.
      > git pull origin branchToCheck
6. Modify the file with :
      > nano fileName  
      > external editor
7. Prepare the file for *staging*.
      > git add fileName
8. Check if file is clean & ready :
      > git status
9. Confirm modification and commit it.
      > git commit -m "What you have done and why ?"
10. Now, you can send your file(s) to the distant repository (alias *remote* ):
      > git push origin branchToPush

11. If work is **WORKING AND VALIDATED**, you can *merge* it on the principal branch.
/!\ Avoid as possible to merge on *master* branch unless if you are alone on the project /!\
      > git checkout confirmedBranch  
      > git merge branchToMerge  
      > git push origin confirmedBranch

## 3. Good practices :
-------------

### 1. Clean & smart commit :  
Commit **single purpose** with a small and clear message is one of the best practice you can do using Git.  
Clearer versionning and easier teamwork. 

### 2. Single-purpose commit :  
When you commit often small changes, it is easier to back-up on the *right version* when error occurs.  

### 3. Use smart branches :  
Use branches with **evident name**. The name have to represent the related work.  
If you have to create multiples branches of a partial work, create them from the main branch of the work.

### 4. Use .gitignore :  
.gitignore is a text file to include in your project folder.  
Specify the files you don't want to commit.  
It's a good practice to don't commit the generated files because .. They will be re-generated by them-self.  

### 5. GITK :
GITK is a *magic command*. It shows you all the details of the repository, the complete branch system, history, ...
